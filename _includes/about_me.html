            I have over 5 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked
            in multiple domains and technologies. While I'm proficient with numereous technologies
            and programming languages such as Python, Groovy, Node.js, Angular, Chatbots etc, my expertise
            is in designing and implementing DevOps solutions over various cloud platforms.

           I love automating things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to hunt and automate every manual task involved in the business processes.
           I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with
           architecture and project management.
